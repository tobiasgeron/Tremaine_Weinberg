# Tremaine_Weinberg

### Summary

This reposity contains everything to perform the Tremaine-Weinberg method on MaNGA galaxies in Python.
More info on the Tremaine-Weinberg method and some papers that use it (not with this package, though):  
Tremaine, Weinberg (1984): https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984ApJ...282L...5T/abstract

Géron et al. (2022): in prep.   

This package was developed for Géron et al. (2022, in prep) and is used there to determine the bar pattern speeds for a large sample of strongly and weakly barred galaxies, using data from MaNGA. The code can be found in Tremaine_Weinberg.py. An example of how to use the code can be found in Example.ipynb. Table 1 and Table 3 from Géron et al. (2022) are found in tables_geron2022/ directory. 

This code has been tested with python 3.7.9, numpy 1.19.2, matplotlib 3.3.2, [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/  ) 1.2.0, [marvin](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 2.7.1, scipy, 1.6.2, csv 1.0.
